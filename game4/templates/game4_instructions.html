        <h1>Game 4: Firm Reactor Instructions</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> Earn tokens by correctly answering two questions in the first round,
            then embark on a multi-round price guessing game as you experience a market moving toward a
            long-run competitive equilibrium, with a few detours along the way. You’ll lose tokens for inaccurate
            guesses and the game ends when you run out of tokens.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 0:</h2>
        <p>
            You’re given a market demand, firm-level cost functions and the current market price.
            You must correctly calculate the profit-maximizing quantity and decide if this firm should enter the market.
            Earn 5 tokens for each question you answer correctly.
        </p>
        <h2>Guessing Rounds:</h2>
        <p>
            In the rounds that follow, you’ll guess the price adjustments as the market experiences a change
            to the number of firms in the market and demand shocks. Inaccurate guesses reduce your tokens,
            but you can replenish tokens with very accurate guesses.
        </p>
        <h2>Scoring:</h2>
        <p>
            Your score is equal to the number of rounds you can remain in the game before losing all of your tokens.
            See how high you can go!
        </p>

        <p class="intro">Welcome to Equilibrium Explorer! This game tests your understanding of supply and demand in a microeconomic context. Here's how to play:</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Round 1: Introduction to Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>In the first round, you will be introduced to the basic concept of equilibrium in supply and demand. The equations for supply and demand will be presented, and the equilibrium quantity will be calculated for you. This round helps you understand the fundamental principles before moving on to the next challenges.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Round 2: Market Shocks</h3>
        <p>In the second round, a random shock will be applied to either the demand or supply curve. The shock could be small, medium, or large. Based on the new equations, you must determine the equilibrium quantity.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Round 3: Multiple Shifts</h3>
        <p>The third round introduces two simultaneous shocks to the market, affecting both demand and supply. Your challenge is to predict the new equilibrium quantity based on the modified equations.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Scoring</h3>
        <p>Your score is based on the total difference between your guesses and the actual equilibrium quantities in rounds 2 and 3. Aim for the smallest difference to top the leaderboard! Over producing is penalized!</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Leaderboard</h3>
        <p>Check the leaderboard to see how you rank against other players. Can you make it to the top?</p>

        <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
